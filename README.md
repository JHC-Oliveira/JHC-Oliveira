I am a dedicated Computer Science student with a passion for technology and innovation. I am currently pursuing my Bachelor`s degree at Dorset College, Dublin, while balancing roles as a kitchen assistant and night porter to support my studies. 

I have built my skillset in algorithms, programming languages (Java, C#), UX/UI design and computer networking in my first year of studies. I am committed to achieving excellence in problem-solving and coding, always eager to learn and grow with the latest industry trends.

Beyond the classroom, my experiences in the hospitality industry have improved my adaptability, teamwork, and communication skills, making me well-equipped to thrive in dynamic professional environments.

Now, I am actively seeking internship opportunities that will allow me to apply my theoretical knowledge and practical skills to real-world projects, contribute meaningfully to innovative initiatives, and continue my journey of learning and growth alongside industry professionals.
